# OpenClaw Central Command Kanban Board

## Project Description
The OpenClaw Central Command Kanban Board is a flexible and dynamic tool designed to track progress on multiple projects. The application will serve as a central command for managing work, tracking ongoing tasks, and providing real-time updates. It is containerized using Docker, with a React frontend and a PostgreSQL backend, and all interactions are API-driven.

### Key Features:
- **React Frontend**: Intuitive and customizable interface for managing tasks and columns.
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Robust database schema to track projects, columns, and tasks.
- **API-driven**: All edits to the Kanban board are handled via RESTful APIs.
- **Flexible Structure**: Ability to add and remove columns dynamically and manage multiple projects.
